🔷 Impact Statement / Vision
Since 2022, The Antwon Harris Group has partnered with 15 schools across multiple districts to build measurable self-equity in students.

Our mission is to strengthen emotional intelligence, increase academic engagement, and develop leadership identity through a structured mentorship ecosystem powered by DISC-based self-awareness and weekly outcome tracking.

We don’t just deliver sessions — we implement measurable systems that improve attendance, reduce work aversion, strengthen peer relationships, and build sustainable student leadership pipelines.

Our goal is simple: equip students to succeed academically today and thrive professionally tomorrow.

Self-Equity Impact Framework
We measure student growth in:

✔ Attendance
✔ Behavior & Attitude
✔ Peer Conflict
✔ Work Aversion
✔ Missing Assignments
✔ Communication Skills

Students are tracked using a 5-level rubric from Unacceptable → Mastery, allowing us to measure growth, proficiency, and long-term improvement.

DISC-Based Differentiation
Every student completes a DISC Bird assessment (Eagle, Parrot, Dove, Owl), allowing mentors to:

Personalize accountability strategies

Strengthen communication development

Support emotional regulation growth

Identify leadership tendencies

This ensures measurable growth is paired with individualized student development.

🎓 Success Stories / Case Studies
Case Study: From Mentee to Mentor
A high school freshman entered the Self-Equity Mentorship Program struggling with engagement and work completion. Through weekly goal tracking, DISC-based strategy coaching, and structured accountability, the student reduced missing assignments and increased classroom participation.

By senior year, that same student became a Peer Mentor, helping younger students navigate the same challenges.

Today, former mentees are transitioning into leadership roles within schools and communities — demonstrating the sustainability of the Self-Equity model.

Case Study: District Leadership Pipeline
College interns trained within the Self-Equity Program have transitioned into educational roles within partner districts — strengthening local educator pipelines while maintaining program continuity.

Our model builds long-term capacity, not temporary intervention.
